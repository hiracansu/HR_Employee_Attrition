# HR_Employee_Attrition
You are expected to train a model on the dataset related to the attrition and performance of employees created by data scientists working at IBM.

1. "IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset" should be downloaded from the Kaggle website.
2. SEED = 12345 should be selected for the sake of experiment reproducibility. This step is mandatory.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis should be performed, including data analysis and visualizations.
4. Necessary data preprocessing steps, such as normalization and feature transformations, should be conducted.
5. The data should be divided into training, validation, and test sets, and cross-validation should be applied with K=5.
6. Models should be trained using Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest algorithms, and the results should be reported using at least four different metrics.
7. The trained models should be evaluated for overfitting.
8. Both the classification performance and the training and testing durations of the models should be compared.
9. Parameter optimization should be performed, and the impact of this optimization on performance should be demonstrated.
10. The top 5 features should be determined using the desired method, and the best-performing model from the previous step should be retrained using these 5 features. The performance and training/testing durations should be compared again.
